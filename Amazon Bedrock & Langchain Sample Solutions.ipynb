    "## **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "[LangChain](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20a%20framework%20for%20developing%20applications%20powered%20by%20language%20models) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Generation**\n",
    "* **Summarization** - One of the most common use case with LLM\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools."
